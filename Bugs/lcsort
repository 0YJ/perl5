Ok, here's a weird one.  Using the precompiled perl5a6 binary for the
sun, the following dumps core:
----
@S = (0, 1, 2, 3);
for ("A", "D", "b", "c") { $foo{$i++} = $_; }
# for (sort { lc($foo{$a}) cmp  lc($foo{$b}) } @S) { print $foo{$_}, "\n"; }
for (sort Alpha @S)      { print $foo{$_}, "\n"; }

sub Alpha { lc($foo{$a}) cmp  lc($foo{$b}); }
----
[Output]
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
----
However, if you comment out the "sort Alpha" and uncomment the "sort
{lc(...) cmp lc(...) }" line, everything works as expected.  Also note
that if you uncomment both "sort"s, everything also works as expected.
Do-do-do-do [twilight zone music :-].

PS: Does anyone actually care about these bug reports?  I thought I
    remember Larry saying that he preferred them in c.l.p., but it
    wouldn't be the first time my memory has fritzed.
