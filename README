If your version of patch can't create a file from scratch, then you'll
need to create an empty thread.h manually first.  Perl itself will need
to be built with -DUSE_THREADS yet. If you're using MIT pthreads or
another threads package that needs pthread_init() to be called, then
add -DNEED_PTHREAD_INIT. If you're using a threads library that only
follows one of the old POSIX drafts, then you'll probably need to add
-DOLD_PTHREADS_API. I haven't tested -DOLD_PTHREADS_API properly yet
and I think you may still have to tweak a couple of the mutex calls
to follow the old API.

These are preliminary patches and although it should be sufficient
to show roughly what's been going on, they're probably not
going to produce a perl of any practical use yet.
