The file thrpatch-oct1 contains patches against perl5.001m which makes
a first stab at a multithreading perl5.  If your version of patch can't
create file from scratch, then you'll need to create an empty thread.h
manually first.  Perl itself will need to be built with -DUSE_THREADS
and very probably -DDEBUGGING since I haven't tested it without that
yet.  If you're using MIT pthreads or another threads package that
needs pthread_init() to be called, then add -DNEED_PTHREAD_INIT.  If
you're not using a threads library that follows the latest POSIX draft,
then you'll probably need to add -DOLD_PTHREADS_API.  I haven't tested
-DOLD_PTHREADS_API properly yet and I think you may still have to tweak
a couple of the mutex calls to follow the old API.

These patches are copyright Malcolm Beattie 1995 and are freely
distributable under your choice of the GNU Public License or the

These are very preliminary patches and although it should be sufficient
to show roughly what's been going on, they're almost certainly not
going to produce a perl of any practical use yet.
