=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.21.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.21.6 release and the 5.21.7
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.5, first read
L<perl5216delta>, which describes differences between 5.21.5 and 5.21.6.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 faster array and hash lookups

Array and hash lookups (especially nested ones) that use only constants
or simple variables as keys, are now considerably faster. See
L</Internal Changes> for more details.

=head2 C<fileno> now works on directory handles

When the relevant support is available in the operating system, the
C<fileno> builtin now works on directory handles, yielding the
underlying file descriptor in the same way as for filehandles. On
operating systems without such support, C<fileno> on a directory handle
continues to return the undefined value, as before, but also sets C<$!> to
indicate that the operation is not supported.

Currently, this uses either a C<dd_fd> member in the OS C<DIR>
structure, or a dirfd(3) function as specified by POSIX.1-2008.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 C<&> and C<\&> prototypes accepts only subs

The C<&> prototype character now accepts only anonymous subs (C<sub {...}>)
and things beginning with C<\&>.  Formerly it erroneously also allowed
C<undef> and references to array, hashes, and lists.  [perl #4539]
[perl #123062]

The C<\&> prototype was allowing subroutine calls, whereas now it only
allows subroutines.  C<&foo> is permitted.  C<&foo()> and C<foo()> are not.
[perl #77860]

=head2 C<use encoding> is now lexical

The L<encoding> pragma's effect is now limited to lexical scope.  This
pragma is deprecated, but in the meantime, it could adversely affect
unrelated modules that are included in the same program.

=head2 List slices returning empty lists

List slices return an empty list now only if the original list was empty
(or if there are no indices).  Formerly, a list slice would return an empty
list if all indices fell outside the original list.  [perl #114498]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=over

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=back

[ List each other deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Setting C<${^ENCODING}> to anything but C<undef>

This variable allows Perl scripts to be written in a non-ASCII,
non-UTF-8 encoding.  However, it affects all modules globally, leading
to wrong answers and segmentation faults.  New scripts should be written
in UTF-8; old scripts should be converted to UTF-8, which is easily done
with the L<encoding> pragma.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

Win32 Perl uses 8 KB less of per-process memory than before for every perl
process of this version. This data is now memory mapped from disk and shared
between perl processes from the same perl binary.

=item *

If method and class names are known at compile time, hashes are precomputed
to speed up run-time method lookup.  Also, compound method names like
C<SUPER::new> are parsed at compile time, to save having to parse them at
run time.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<B> has been upgraded from version 1.53 to 1.54.

Nulled COPs are now of class C<B::COP>, rather than C<B::OP>.

B::REGEXP objects now provide a C<qr_anoncv> method for accessing the
implicit CV associated with C<qr//> things containing code blocks.

B::PMOP now provides a C<pmregexp> method returning a B::REGEXP object.

Two new classes, B::PADNAME and B::PADNAMELIST, have been introduced.

=item *

L<B::Deparse> has been upgraded from version 1.30 to 1.31.

BEGIN blocks at the end of the enclosing scope are now deparsed in the
right place.  [perl #77452]

BEGIN blocks were sometimes deparsed as __ANON__, but are now always called
BEGIN.

Lexical subroutines are now fully deparsed.  [perl #116553]

Deparsing of C<$lexical =~ //> was accidentally broken in 1.30 (perl
5.21.6), omitting the C<$lexical =~>, but has now been fixed.

C<Anything =~ y///r> with C</r> no longer omits the left-hand operand.

The op trees that make up regexp code blocks are now deparsed for real.
Formerly, the original string that made up the regular expression was used.
That caused problems with C<qr/(?{<<heredoc})/> and multiline code blocks,
which were deparsed incorrectly.  [perl #123217] [perl #115256]

C<$;> at the end of a statement no longer loses its semicolon.
[perl #123357]

Some cases of subroutine declarations stored in the stash in shorthand form
were being omitted.

Non-ASCII characters are now consistently escaped in strings, instead of
some of the time.  (There are still outstanding problems with regular
expressions and identifiers that have not been fixed.)

When prototype sub calls are deparsed with C<&> (e.g., under the B<-P>
option), C<scalar> is now added where appropriate, to force the scalar
context implied by the prototype.

C<require(foo())>, C<do(foo())>, C<goto(foo())> and similar constructs with
loop controls are now deparsed correctly.  The outer parentheses are not
optional.

Whitespace is no longer escaped in regular expressions, because it was
getting erroneously escaped within C<(?x:...)> sections.

C<sub foo { foo() }> is now deparsed with those mandatory parentheses.

C</@array/> is now deparsed as a regular expression, and not just
C<@array>.

C</@{-}/>, C</@{+}/> and C<$#{1}> are now deparsed with the braces, which
are mandatory in these cases.

In deparsing feature bundles, B::Deparse was emitting C<no feature;> first
instead of C<no feature ':all';>.  This has been fixed.

C<chdir FH> is now deparsed without quotation marks.

C<\my @a> is now deparsed without parentheses.  (Parenthese would flatten
the array.)

=item *

L<ExtUtils::ParseXS> has been upgraded from version 3.26 to 3.27.

Only declare C<file> unused if we actually define it.

Improve generated C<RETVAL> code generation to avoid repeated
references to C<ST(0)>.  [perl #123278]

Broaden and document the C</OBJ$/> to C</REF$/> typemap optimization
for the C<DESTROY> method.  [perl #123418]

=item *

L<Locale::Maketext> has been upgraded from version 1.25 to 1.26.

=item *

The PathTools module collection has been upgraded from 3.52 to 3.53.

Don't turn leading C<//> into C</> on Cygwin. [perl #122635]

=item *

L<PerlIO::scalar> has been upgraded from version 0.20 to 0.21.

Reading from a position well past the end of the scalar now correctly
returns end of file.  [perl #123443]

Seeking to a negative position still fails, but no longer leaves the
file position set to a negation location.

C<eof()> on a C<PerlIO::scalar> handle now properly returns true when
the file position is past the 2GB mark on 32-bit systems.

=item *

L<XSLoader> has been upgraded from version 0.19 to 0.20

Don't test twice for bootstrap file.

The PADNAME and PADNAMELIST types are now separate types, and no longer
simply aliases for SV and AV.  [perl #123223]

=item *

Pad names are now always UTF8.  The C<PadnameUTF8> macro always returns
true.  Previously, this was effectively the case already, but any support
for two different internal representations of pad names has now been
removed.

=item *

The C<OP_SIBLING> and C<OP_HAS_SIBLING> macros added in an earlier 5.21.x
release have been renamed C<OpSIBLING> and C<OpHAS_SIBLING>, following the
existing convention.

=item *

A new op class, C<UNOP_AUX>, has been added. This is a subclass of
C<UNOP> with an C<op_aux> field added, which points to an array of unions
of C<UV>, C<SV*> etc. It is intended for where an op needs to store more data
than a simple C<op_sv> or whatever. Currently the only op of this type is
C<OP_MULTIDEREF> (see below).

=item *

A new op has been added, C<OP_MULTIDEREF>, which performs one or more
nested array and hash lookups where the key is a constant or simple
variable. For example the expression C<$a[0]{$k}[$i]>, which previously
involved ten C<rv2Xv>, C<Xelem>, C<gvsv> and C<const> ops is now performed
by a single C<multideref> op. It can also handle C<local>, C<exists> and
C<delete>. A non-simple index expression, such as C<[$i+1]> is still done
using C<aelem/helem>, and single-level array lookup with a small constant
index is still done using C<aelemfast>.

=item *

On Win32, restoring in a child pseudo-process a variable that was
C<local()>ed in a parent pseudo-process before the C<fork> happened caused
memory corruption and a crash in the child pseudo-process (and therefore OS
process).  [perl #40565]

=item *

Calling C<write> on a format with a C<^**> field could produce a panic
in sv_chop() if there were insufficient arguments or if the variable
used to fill the field was empty.  [perl #123245]

=item *

Non-ASCII lexical sub names (use in error messages) on longer have extra
junk on the end.

=item *

The C<\@> subroutine prototype no longer flattens parenthesized arrays
(taking a reference to each element), but takes a reference to the array
itself.  [perl #47363]

=item *

A block containing nothing except a C-style C<for> loop could corrupt the
stack, causing lists outside the block to lose elements or have elements
overwritten.  This could happen with C<map { for(...){...} } ...> and with
lists containing C<do { for(...){...} }>.  [perl #123286]

=item *

C<scalar()> now propagates lvalue context, so that
C<for(scalar($#foo)) { ... }> can modify C<$#foo> through C<$_>.

=item *

C<qr/@array(?{block})/> no longer dies with "Bizarre copy of ARRAY".
[#123344]

=item *

C<eval '$variable'> in nested named subroutines would sometimes look up a
global variable even with a lexical variable in scope.

In perl 5.20.0, C<sort CORE::fake> where 'fake' is anything other than a
keyword started chopping of the last 6 characters and treating the result
as a sort sub name.  The previous behaviour of treating "CORE::fake" as a
sort sub name has been restored.  [perl #123410]

=item *

Outside of C<use utf8>, a single-character Latin-1 lexical variable is
disallowed.  The error message for it, "Can't use global $foo...", was
giving garbage instead of the variable name.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
