=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.29.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.29.9 release and the 5.29.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.29.8, first read
L<perl5299delta>, which describes differences between 5.29.8 and 5.29.9.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Perl now supports draft Unicode 12.1

Unicode 12.1 differs from 12.0 only in the addition of a single
character, that for the new Japanese era name.  The intent is to ship
Perl 5.30 with Unicode 12.1.  The final release of 12.1 is scheduled for
May 7, 2019.  Hopefully, there won't be any code changes to the draft
after the release of Perl 5.29.10.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

A new function L<perlapi/C<my_strtod>> or its synonym, Strtod(), is
now available with the same signature as the libc strtod().  It provides
strotod() equivalent behavior on all platforms, using the best available
precision, depending on platform capabilities and F<Configure> options,
while handling locale-related issues, such as if the radix character
should be a dot or comma.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Perl now exposes POSIX C<getcwd> as C<Internals::getcwd()> if
available.  This is intended for use by C<Cwd.pm> during bootstrapping
and may be removed or changed without notice.  This fixes some
bootstrapping issues while building perl in a directory where some
ancestor directory isn't readable.  [perl #133951]

=head1 Errata From Previous Releases

=over 4

=item *

The perldelta for 5.29.9 listed the enhancement about regular expression
lookbehind in the C<Security> section rather than the C<Core Enhancements>
section.  Its title should also have indicated that it is "Limited"
variable-length lookbehind (up to 255 characters).  (Note that a
technique has now been published to achieve arbitrary variable length
lookbehind with pre-existing Perl constructs and is linked to in L<perlre>.
It is 
L<http://www.drregex.com/2019/02/variable-length-lookbehinds-actually.html>.)

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.29.10 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.29.9 and contains approximately 29,000 lines of changes across 230 files
from 19 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 21,000 lines of changes to 98 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.10:

der Sanden, James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Niko Tyni,
Richard Leach, Sawyer X, Sisyphus, Steve Hay, Tomasz Konojacki, Tom Wyant,

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
