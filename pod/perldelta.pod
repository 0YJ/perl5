=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.13.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.XXX.XXX release and
the 5.XXX.XXX release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.YYY.YYY, first read
L<perl5YYYdelta>, which describes differences between 5.ZZZ.ZZZ and
5.YYY.YYY.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Add C<\p{Titlecase}> as a synonym for C<\p{Title}>

This synyom is added for symmetry with the Unicode property names
C<\p{Uppercase}> and C<\p{Lowercase}>.


=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX. If any
    exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Most C<\p{}> properties are now immune from case-insensitive matching

For most Unicode properties, it doesn't make sense to have them match
differently under C</i> case-insensitive matching than not.  And doing
so leads to unexpected results and potential security holes.  For
example

 m/\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}+/i

could previously match non-ASCII characters because of the Unicode
matching rules.  There were a number of bugs in this feature until an
earlier release in the 5.13 series.  Now this release reverts, and
removes the feature completely except for the few properties where
people have come to expect it, namely the ones where casing is an
integral part of their functionality, such as C<m/\p{Uppercase}/i> and
C<m/\p{Lowercase}/i>, both of which match the exact same code points,
namely those matched by C<m/\p{Cased}/i>.  Details are in
L<perlrecharclass/Unicode Properties>.

User-defined property handlers that need to match differently under
C</i> must change to read the new boolean parameter passed it which is
non-zero if case-insensitive matching is in effect; 0 if not.  See
L<perluniprops/User-Defined Character Properties>.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.
In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are
listed as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There
may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

C<CGI> has been upgraded from version 3.51 to 3.52

C<IPC::Cmd> has been upgraded from version 0.68 to 0.70

=item *

C<HTTP::Tiny> has been upgraded from version 0.009 to 0.010

=item *

C<Module::Build> has been upgraded from version 0.3607 to 0.3622.

A notable change is the deprecation of several modules.
Module::Build::Version has been deprecated and Module::Build now relies
directly upon L<version>.  Module::Build::ModuleInfo has been deprecated in
favor of a standalone copy of it called L<Module::Metadata>.
Module::Build::YAML has been deprecated in favor of L<CPAN::Meta::YAML>.

=item *

C<Module::Metadata> has been upgraded from version 1.000003 to 1.000004.

=item *

C<Parse::CPAN::Meta> has been upgraded from version 1.40 to 1.4401.

The latest Parse::CPAN::Meta can now read YAML or JSON files using
L<CPAN::Meta::YAML> and L<JSON::PP>, which are now part of the Perl core.

=item *

C<Unicode::Collate> has been upgraded from version 0.68 to 0.72

This also sees the switch from using the pure-perl version of this
module to the XS version.`

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

XXX Changes which significantly change existing files in F<pod/> go here.
However, any changes to F<pod/perldiag.pod> should go in the L</Diagnostics>
section.

=head3 L<perlhack> and perlrepository

=over 4

=item *

The L<perlhack> and perlrepository documents have been heavily edited and
split up into several new documents.

The L<perlhack> document is now much shorter, and focuses on the Perl 5
development process and submitting patches to Perl. The technical content has
been moved to several new documents, L<perlsource>, L<perlinterp>,
L<perlhacktut>, and L<perlhacktips>. This technical content has only been
lightly edited.

The perlrepository document has been renamed to L<perlgit>. This new document
is just a how-to on using git with the Perl source code. Any other content
that used to be in perlrepository has been moved to perlhack.

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
