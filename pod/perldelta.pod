=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.21.11

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.21.10 release and the 5.21.11
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.9, first read
L<perl52110delta>, which describes differences between 5.21.9 and 5.21.10.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Making all warnings fatal is discouraged

The documentation for L<fatal warnings|warnings/Fatal Warnings> notes
that C<< use warnings FATAL => 'all' >> is discouraged
and provides stronger language about the risks of fatal warnings
in general.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=item Win32

F<miniperl.exe> is now built with C<-fno-strict-aliasing>, allowing
64-bit builds to complete on GCC 4.8. [perl #123976]

C<test-prep> again depends on C<test-prep-gcc> for GCC builds. [perl
#124221]

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

5.21.2 introduced a new build option, C<-DPERL_OP_PARENT>, which causes
the last C<op_sibling> pointer to refer back to the parent rather than
being C<NULL>, and where instead a new flag indicates the end of the
chain. In this release, the new implementation has been revised; in
particular:

=over 4

=item *

On C<PERL_OP_PARENT> builds, the C<op_sibling> field has been renamed
C<op_sibparent> to reflect its new dual purpose. Since the intention is that
this field should primarily be accessed via macros, this change should be
transparent for code written to work under C<PERL_OP_PARENT>.

=item *

The newly-introduced C<op_lastsib> flag bit has been renamed C<op_moresib>
and its logic inverted; i.e. it is initialised to zero in a new op, and is
changed to 1 when an op gains a sibling.

=item *

The function C<Perl_op_parent> is now only available on C<PERL_OP_PARENT>
builds. Using it on a plain build will be a compile-timer error.

=item *

Three new macros, C<OpMORESIB_set>, C<OpLASTSIB_set>, C<OpMAYBESIB_set>
have been added, which are intended to be be a low-level portable way to
set C<op_sibling> / C<op_sibparent> while also updating C<op_moresib>.
The first sets the sibling pointer to a new sibling, the second makes the
op the last sibling, and the third conditionally does the first or second
action. The C<op_sibling_splice()> function is retained as a higher-level
interface that can also maintain consistency in the parent at the same time
(e.g. by updating C<op_first> and C<op_last> where appropriate).

=item *

The macro C<OpSIBLING_set>, added in 5.21.2, has been removed. It didn't
manipulate C<op_moresib> and has been superseded by C<OpMORESIB_set> et
al.

=item *

The C<op_sibling_splice> function now accepts a null C<parent> argument
where the splicing doesn't affect the first or last ops in the sibling
chain, and thus where the parent doesn't need to be updated accordingly.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarized here.  Bug fixes in
files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

C<pack("D", $x)> and C<pack("F", $x)> now zero the padding on x86 long
double builds.  GCC 4.8 and later, under some build options, would
either overwrite the zero-initialized padding, or bypass the
initialized buffer entirely.  This caused F<op/pack.t> to fail.  [perl
#123971]

=item *

Extending an array cloned from a parent thread could result in
"Modification of a read-only value attempted" errors when attempting
to modify the new elements. [perl #124127]

=item *

An assertion failure and subsequent crash with C<< *x=<y> >> has been fixed.
[perl #123790]

=item *

An optimization for state variable initialization introduced in Perl 5.21.6 has
been reverted because it was found to exacerbate some other existing buggy
behaviour. [perl #124160]

=item *

The extension of another optimization to cover more ops in Perl 5.21 has also
been reverted to its Perl 5.20 state as a temporary fix for regression issues
that it caused. [perl #123790]

=item *

New bitwise ops added in Perl 5.21.9 accidentally caused C<$^H |= 0x1c020000>
to enable all features.  This has now been fixed.

=item *

A possible crashing/looping bug has been fixed. [perl #124099]

=item *

UTF-8 variable names used in array indexes, unquoted UTF-8 HERE-document
terminators and UTF-8 function names all now work correctly. [perl #124113]

=item *

Breakage in C<require(VERSION)> (with parentheses), introduced in Perl 5.21.6,
has been fixed. [perl #124135]

=item *

Wide char warnings, wrongly raised in UTF-8 locales since Perl 5.21.8, are now
suppressed. [perl #123527]

=item *

A subtle bug introduced in Perl 5.21.4 involving UTF-8 in regular expressions
and sometimes causing a crash has been fixed. A new test script has been added
to test this fix; see under L</Testing>. [perl #124109]

=item *

A change introduced in Perl 5.21.10 that broke the autovivification CPAN module
has been reverted.

=item *

A bug whereby C<< 'FOO'->f() >> lost the read-only status of C<FOO>, introduced
in Perl 5.21.7, has been fixed. [perl #123619]

=item *

A regression in Perl 5.21 in the matching of C</[A-Z]/ai> has been fixed.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
