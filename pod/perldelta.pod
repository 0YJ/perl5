=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.31.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.31.9 release and the 5.31.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.31.8, first read
L<perl5319delta>, which describes differences between 5.31.8 and 5.31.9.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Unicode 13.0 is supported

See L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/> for details.

=head2 It is now possible to write C<qr/\p{Name=...}/>, or
C<qr!\p{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING) FACE/}!>

The Unicode Name property is now accessible in regular expression
patterns, as an alternative to C<\N{...}>.
A comparison of the two methods is given in
L<perlunicode/Comparison of \N{...} and \p{name=...}>.

The second example above shows that wildcard subpatterns are also usable
in this property.  See L<perlunicode/Wildcards in Property Values>.

=head2 Chained comparisons capability

Some comparison operators, as their associativity, I<chain> with some
operators of the same precedence (but never with operators of different
precedence).

    if ( $x < $y <= $z ) {...}

behaves exactly like:

    if ( $x < $y && $y <= $z ) {...}

(assuming that C<"$y"> is as simple a scalar as it looks.)

You can read more about this in L<perlop> under
L<perlop/Operator Precedence and Associativity>.

=head1 Obituary

Jeff Goff (JGOFF or DrForr), an integral part of the Perl and Raku
communities and a dear friend to all of us, has passed away on March
11th, 2020. DrForr was a prominent member of the communities, attending
and speaking at countless events, contributing to numerous projects,
and assisting and helping with everything.

His passing leaves a hole in our hearts and in our communities and he
will be sorely missed.
