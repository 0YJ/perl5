=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as
XXX needs to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.17.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.17.0 release and
the 5.17.1 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read
L<perl5170delta>, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and
5.17.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 More CORE:: subs

Several more built-in functions have been added as subroutines to the
CORE:: namespace, namely, those non-overridable keywords that can be
implemented without custom parsers: C<defined>, C<delete>, C<exists>,
C<glob>, C<pos>, C<protoytpe>, C<scalar>, C<split>, C<study>, C<undef>,

As some of these have prototypes, C<prototype('CORE::...')> has been
changed not to make a distinction between overridable and non-overridable
keywords.  This is to make C<prototype('CORE::pos')> consistent with
C<prototype(&CORE::pos)>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

=head2 C<\N{BELL}> now refers to U+1F514 instead of U+0007

Unicode 6.0 reused the name "BELL" for a different code point than it
traditionally had meant.  Since Perl v5.14, use of this name still
referred to U+0007, but would raise a deprecated warning.  Now, "BELL"
refers to U+1F514, and the name for U+0007 is "ALERT".  All the
functions in L<charnames> have been correspondingly updated.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.
In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are
listed as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There
may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

The C<study> function was made a no-op in 5.16.  It was simply disabled via
a C<return> statement; the code was left in place.  Now the code supporting
what C<study> used to do has been removed.

=item *

Under threaded perls, there is no longer a separate PV allocated for every
COP to store its package name (C<< cop->stashpv >>).  Instead, there is an
offset (C<< cop->stashoff >>) into the new C<PL_stashpad> array, which
holds stash pointers.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarised here.
Bug fixes in files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarised in
L</Modules and Pragmata>.

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

Perl now works as well as can be expected on all releases of Unicode so
far.  In v5.16, it worked on Unicodes 6.0 and 6.1, but there were
various bugs for earlier releases; the older the release the more
problems.

=item *

C<vec> no longer produces "uninitialized" warnings in lvalue context
[perl #9423].

=item *

An optimisation involving fixed strings in regular expressions could cause
a severe performance penalty in edge cases.  This has been fixed
[perl #76546].

=item *

The "Can't find an opnumber" message that C<prototype> produces when passed
a string like "CORE::nonexistent_keyword" is now passes UTF8 and embedded
nulls through unchanged [perl #97478].

=item *

C<prototype> now treats magical variables like C<$1> the same way as
non-magical variables when checking for the CORE:: prefix, instead of
treating them as subroutine names.

=item *

Under threaded perls, a run-time code block in a regular expression could
corrupt the package name stored in the op tree, resulting in bad reads
in C<caller>, and possibly crashes [perl #113060].

=item *

Referencing a closure prototype (C<\&{$_[1]}> in an attribute handler for a
closure) no longer results in a copy of the subroutine (or assertion
failures on debugging builds).

=item *

C<eval '__PACKAGE__'> now returns the right answer on threaded builds if
the current package has been assigned over (as in
C<*ThisPackage:: = *ThatPackage::>) [perl #78742].

=item *

If a package is deleted by code that it calls, it is possible for C<caller>
to see a stack frame belonging to that deleted package.  C<caller> could
crash if the stash's memory address was reused for a scalar and a
substitution was performed on the same scalar [perl #113486].

=item *

C<UNIVERSAL::can> no longer treats its first argument differently
depending on whether it is a string or number internally.

=item *

C<open> with "<&" for the mode checks to see whether the third argument is
a number, in determining whether to treat it as a file descriptor or a
handle name.  Magical variables like C<$1> were always failing the numeric
check and being treated as handle names.

=item *

C<warn>'s handling of magical variables (C<$1>, ties) has undergone several
fixes.  FETCH is only called once now on a tied argument or a tied C<$@>
[perl #97480].  Tied variables returning objects that stringify as "" are
no longer ignored.  A tied C<$@> that happened to return a reference the
I<previous> time is was used is no longer ignored.

=item *

Numeric operators on magical variables (e.g., S<C<$1 + 1>>) used to use
floating point operations even where integer operations were more appropriate, resulting in loss of accuracy on 64-bit platforms
[perl #109542].

=item *

Unary negation no longer treats a string as a number if the string happened
to be used as a number some time.  So, if $x contains the string "dogs",
C<-$x> returns "-dogs" even if C<$y=0+$x> has happened at some point.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
