=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.23.4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.23.3 release and the 5.23.4
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.23.2, first read
L<perl5233delta>, which describes differences between 5.23.2 and 5.23.3.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Lexical $_ has been removed

C<my $_> was introduced in Perl 5.10, and subsequently caused much confusion
with no obvious solution.  In Perl 5.18.0, it was made experimental on the
theory that it would either be removed or redesigned in a less confusing (but
backward-incompatible) way.  Over the following years, no alternatives were
proposed.  The feature has now been removed and will fail to compile.

=head2 Only blanks and tabs are now allowed within C<[...]> within C<(?[...])>.

The experimental Extended Bracketed Character Classes can contain regular
bracketed character classes within them.  These differ from regular ones in
that white space is generally ignored, unless escaped by preceding it with a
backslash.  The white space that is ignored is now limited to just tab C<\t>
and SPACE characters.  Previously, it was any white space.  See
L<perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=over

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=item *

C</fixed-substr/> has been made much faster.

On platforms with a libc memchr() implementation which makes good use of
underlying hardware support, patterns which include fixed substrings will now
often be much faster; for example with glibc on on a recent x86_64 CPU, this:

    $s = "a" x 1000 . "wxyz";
    $s =~ /wxyz/ for 1..30000

is now about 7 times faster.  On systems with slow memchr(), e.g. 32-bit ARM
Raspberry Pi, there will be a small or little speedup.  Conversely, some
pathological cases, such as C<"ab" x 1000 =~ /aa/> will be slower now; up to 3
times slower on the rPi, 1.5x slower on x86_64.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=item MacOS X

=over

=item *

Until now OS X builds of perl have specified a link target of 10.3 (Panther,
2003) but have not specified a compiler target.  From now on, builds of perl on
OS X 10.6 or later (Snow Leopard, 2008) by default capture the current OS X
version and specify that as the explicit build target in both compiler and
linker flags, thus preserving binary compatibility for extensions built later
regardless of changes in OS X, SDK, or compiler and linker versions.  To
override the default value used in the build and preserved in the flags,
specify C<export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.N> before configuring and building
perl, where 10.N is the version of OS X you wish to target.  In OS X 10.5 or
earlier there is no change to the behavior present when those systems were
current; the link target is still OS X 10.3 and there is no explicit compiler
target.

=back

=item VMS

=over

=item *

Perl now implements its own C<killpg> by scanning for processes in the
specified process group, which may not mean exactly the same thing as a Unix
process group, but allows us to send a signal to a parent (or master) process
and all of its sub-processes.  At the perl level, this means we can now send a
negative pid like so:

    kill SIGKILL, -$pid;

to signal all processes in the same group as C<$pid>.

=back

=item Win32

=over

=item *

A new build option C<USE_NO_REGISTRY> has been added to the makefiles.  This
option is off by default, meaning the default is to do Windows registry
lookups.  This option stops Perl from looking inside the registry for anything.
For what values are looked up in the registry see L<perlwin32>.  Internally, in
C, the name of this option is C<WIN32_NO_REGISTRY>.

=item *

The behavior of Perl using C<HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl> and
C<HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl> to lookup certain values, including C<%ENV>
vars starting with C<PERL> has changed.  Previously, the 2 keys were checked
for entries at all times through Perl processes life time even if they did not
exist.  For performance reasons, now, if the root key (i.e.
C<HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl> or C<HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl>) does
not exist at process start time, it will not be checked again for C<%ENV>
override entries for the remainder of the Perl processes life.  This more
closely matches Unix behaviour in that the environment is copied or inherited
on startup and changing the variable in the parent process or another process
or editing <.bashrc> will not change the environmental variable in other
existing, running, processes.

=item *

One glob fetch was removed for each C<-X> or C<stat> call whether done from
Perl code or internally from Perl's C code.  The glob being looked up was
C<${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}> which is a special variable.  This makes C<-X> and
C<stat> slightly faster.

=item *

During miniperl's process startup, during the build process, 4 to 8 IO calls

L<perlapi/sv_backoff> had its return type changed from C<int> to C<void>.  It
previously has always returned C<0> since Perl 5.000 stable but that was
undocumented.  Although C<sv_backoff> is marked as public API, XS code is not
expected to be impacted since the proper API call would be through public API
C<sv_setsv(sv, &PL_sv_undef)>, or quasi-public C<SvOOK_off>, or non-public
C<SvOK_off> calls, and the return value of C<sv_backoff> was previously a
meaningless constant that can be rewritten as C<(sv_backoff(sv),0)>.

=item *

The C<EXTEND> and C<MEXTEND> macros have been improved to avoid various issues
with integer truncation and wrapping.  In particular, some casts formerly used
within the macros have been removed.  This means for example that passing an
unsigned nitems arg is likely to raise a compiler warning now (it's always been
documented to require a signed value; formerly int, lately SSize_t).

Some problems with attempting to extend the perl stack to around 2G or 4G
entries have been fixed.  This was particularly an issue on 32-bit perls built
to use 64-bit integers, and was easily noticeable with the list repetition
operator, e.g.

    @a = (1) x $big_number

Formerly perl may have crashed, depending on the exact value of C<$big_number>;
now it will typically raise an exception.

The way that C<OP_AASSIGN> handles assignment with potentially common values

flag has been replaced with three more specific flags:

    OPpASSIGN_COMMON_AGG
    OPpASSIGN_COMMON_RC1
    OPpASSIGN_COMMON_SCALAR

and the runtime now sometimes does a mark and sweep using the C<SVf_BREAK> to

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
