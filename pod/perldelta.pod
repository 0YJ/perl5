=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.29.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.29.7 release and the 5.29.8
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.29.6, first read
L<perl5297delta>, which describes differences between 5.29.6 and 5.29.7.

=head1 Notice

sv_utf8_(downgrade|decode) are no longer marked as experimental [perl #133788]

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Use faster method to convert to UTF-8

There is a special inline function that's used when converting a single
byte to UTF-8, that is faster than the more general one used prior to
this commit.

=head2 Turkic UTF-8 locales are now seamlessly supported

Turkic languages have different casing rules than other languages for
the characters C<"i"> and C<"I">.  The uppercase of C<"i"> is LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130); and the lowercase of C<"I"> is LATIN
SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131).  Unicode furnishes alternate casing
rules for use with Turkic languages.  Previously, Perl ignored these,
but now, it uses them when it detects that it is operating under a
Turkic UTF-8 locale.

=head2 Eliminate opASSIGN macro usage from core

This macro is still defined but no longer used in core

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 JSON::PP enable allow_nonref by default

As JSON::XS 4.0 changed its policy and enabled allow_nonref
by default, JSON::PP also enabled allow_nonref by default.

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs
that they represent may be covered elsewhere.

XXX If there were no significant test changes, say this:

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

XXX If instead there were significant changes, say this:

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and
changes in this release.  Furthermore, these significant changes were

Regular expression matching no longer leaves stale UTF-8 length magic

an incorrect value.

Fix a qr/[...]/ bug introduced in v5.29.7

Using /il should not result in looking for a [:posix:] class
that matches the code points given.

=item *

Reduce recursion on ops [perl #108276]

This can prevent stack overflow when processing extremely deep op
trees.

=item *

Avoid leak in multiconcat with overloading. [perl #133789]

=item *

The handling of user-defined C<\p{}> properties (see
L<perlunicode/User-Defined Character Properties>) has been rewritten to
be in C (instead of Perl).  This speeds things up, but in the process
several inconsistencies and bug fixes are made.

=over

=item 1

A few error messages have minor wording changes.  This is essentially
because the new way is integrated into the regex error handling
mechanism that marks the position in the input at which the error
occurred.  That was not possible previously.  The messages now also
contain additional back-trace-like information in case the error occurs
deep in nested calls.

=item 2

A user-defined property is implemented as a perl subroutine with certain
highly constrained naming conventions.  It was documented previously
that the sub would be in the current package if the package was
unspecified.  This turned out not to be true in all cases, but now it
is.

=item 3

All recursive calls are treated as infinite recursion.  Previously they
would cause the interpreter to panic.  Now, they cause the regex pattern
to fail to compile.

=item 4

Similarly, any other error likely would lead to a panic; now to just the
pattern failing to compile.

=item 5

The old mechanism did not detect illegal ranges in the definition of the
property.  Now, the range max must not be smaller than the range min.
Otherwise, the pattern fails to compile.

=item 6

The intention was to have each sub called only once during the lifetime
of the program, so that a property's definition is immutable.  This was
relaxed so that it could be called once for all /i compilations, and
potentially a second time for non-/i (the sub is passed a parameter
indicating which).  However, in practice there were instances when this
was broken, and multiple calls were possible.  Those have been fixed.
Now (besides the /i,non-/i cases) the only way a sub can be called
multiple times is if some component of it has not been defined yet.  For
example, suppose we have sub IsA() whose definition is known at compile
time, and it in turn calls isB() whose definition is not yet known.
isA() will be called each time a pattern it appears in is compiled.  If
isA() also calls isC() and that definition is known, isC() will be
called just once.

=item 7

There were some races and very long hangs should one thread be compiling
the same property as another simultaneously.  These have now been fixed.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
