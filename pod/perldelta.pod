=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.31.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.31.4 release and the 5.31.5
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.31.3, first read
L<perl5314delta>, which describes differences between 5.31.3 and 5.31.4.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Modifiable variables are no longer permitted in constants

Code like:

    my $var;
    $sub = sub () { $var };

where C<$var> is referenced elsewhere in some sort of modiable context
now produces an exception when the sub is defined.

This error can be avoided by adding a return to the sub definition:

    $sub = sub () { return $var };

This has been deprecated since perl 5.22.

[perl #131138]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email
to L<perlbug@perl.org|mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.

Details of the various stacks within the perl interpreter are now explained
here.

Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

=head3 URLs have been changed to https://, stale links updated

=item *

Where applicable, the URLs in the documentation have been moved from
using the http:// protocol to https:// . This also affects the location
of the bug tracker at L<https://rt.perl.org>.

=item *

Some links to OS/2 libraries, Address Sanitizer and other system tools
had gone stale. These have been updated with working links.

Some links to old mails on perl5-porters had gone stale. These have been
updated with working links.

=head1 Diagnostics

The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 Changes to Existing Diagnostics

=item *

L<Can't use global %s in %s|perldiag/"Can't use global %s in %s">

This error message has been slightly reformatted from the original C<Can't use
global %s in "%s">, and in particular misleading error messages like C<Can't
use global $_ in "my"> are now rendered as C<Can't use global $_ in subroutine
signature>.

=item *

L<Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are no longer permitted|perldiag/"Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are no longer permitted">

This error message replaces the former C<Constants from lexical variables
potentially modified elsewhere are deprecated. This will not be allowed in Perl
5.32> to reflect the fact that this previously deprecated usage has now been
transformed into an exception.  The message's classification has also been
updated from D (deprecated) to F (fatal).

=head1 Utility Changes

XXX Changes to installed programs such as F<perlbug> and F<xsubpp> go here.

L</Platform Support> section, instead.

[ List changes as an =item entry ].

Perl now no longer probes for C<d_u32align>, defaulting to C<define>
on all platforms.  This check was error prone when it was done, which
was on 32-bit platforms only.  [perl #133495]

=item *

Documentation and hints for building perl on Z/OS (native EBCDIC) have
been updated. Still work in progress.

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs
that they represent may be covered elsewhere.

XXX If there were no significant test changes, say this:

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as

Added the C<<PL_curstackinfo->si_cxsubix>> field. This records the stack
index of the most recently pushed sub/format/eval context.  It is set and
restored automatically by C<cx_pushsub()>, C<cx_popsub()> etc., but would
need to be manually managed if you do any unusual manipulation of the
context stack.

=item *

Various macros dealing with character type classification and changing
case where the input is encoded in UTF-8 now require an extra parameter
to prevent potential reads beyond the end of the buffer.  Use of these
has generated a deprecation warning since 5.26.  Details are in
L<perldeprecation/In XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.>

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
