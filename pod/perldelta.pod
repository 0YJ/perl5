=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.21.10

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.21.9 release and the 5.21.10
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.21.8, first read
L<perl5219delta>, which describes differences between 5.21.8 and 5.21.9.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 C<(?[...])> operators now follow standard Perl precedence

This experimental feature allows set operations in regular expression
patterns.  Prior to this, the intersection operator had the same
precedence as the other binary operators.  Now it has higher precedence.
This could lead to different outcomes than existing code expects (though
the documentation has always noted that this change might happen,
recommending fully parenthesizing the expressions).  See
L<perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

The functions
C<utf8::native_to_unicode()> and
C<utf8::unicode_to_native()> (see L<utf8>)
are now optimized out on ASCII platforms.
There is now not even a minimal performance hit in writing code portable
between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=item z/OS running EBCDIC Code Page 1047

Core perl now works on this EBCDIC platform.  Early perls also worked,
but, even though support wasn't officially withdrawn, recent perls would
not compile and run well.  Perl v5.20 would work, but had many bugs
which have now been fixed.  Many CPAN modules that ship with Perl still
fail tests, including Pod::Simple.  However the version of Pod::Simple
currently on CPAN should work; it was fixed too late to include in
Perl v5.22.  Work is under way to fix many of the still-broken CPAN
modules, which likely will be installed on CPAN when completed, so that
you may not have to wait until v5.24 to get a working version.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
