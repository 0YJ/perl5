=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.11.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.11.4 release and
the 5.11.5 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.11.3, first read
L<perl5114delta>, which describes differences between 5.11.3 and
5.11.4.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 32-bit limit on substr arguments removed

The 32-bit limit on C<substr> arguments has now been removed. The full range
of the system's signed and unsigned integers is now available for the C<pos>
and C<len> arguments.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Pragmata Changes

=over 4

=item C<version>

Upgraded from version 0.81 to 0.82.

The C<is_lax> and C<is_strict> functions can now be optionally exported to the
caller's namespace and are also now documented.

Undefined version objects are now uninitialized with zero rather than C<undef>.

=back

=head2 Updated Modules

=over 4

=item C<CPAN>

Upgraded from version 1.94_53 to 1.94_55.

This module is also now built in a less specialized way, which resolves a
problem that caused C<make> after C<make clean> to fail, fixing RT #72218.

=item C<CPANPLUS::Dist::Build>

Upgraded from version 0.44 to 0.46.

=item C<Safe>

Upgraded from version 2.21 to 2.22.

This resolves RT #72700, in which an exception thrown from a closure was
getting lost.

=item C<podlators>

Upgraded from version 2.2.2 to 2.3.0.

=back

=head1 Changes to Existing Documentation

The syntax C<unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK> is now documented as valid, as
is the syntax C<unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK>,
although actually using the latter may not be the best idea for the
readability of your source code.

=head1 Installation and Configuration Improvements

=head2 Configuration improvements

Support for SystemTap's C<dtrace> compatibility layer has been added and an
issue with linking C<miniperl> has been fixed in the process.

C<less -R> is now used instead of C<less> for C<groff>'s new usage of ANSI
escape codes by setting C<$Config{less}> (and thereby C<$Config{pager}>,
which fixes RT #72156.

USE_PERL_ATOF is now reported in the compile-time options listed by the C<-V>
switch.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Arbitrary whitespace is now allowed between C<NAME> and C<VERSION> in
C<package NAME VERSION;> statements. (Fixes RT #72432)

=item *

A panic caused by trying to load C<charnames> when the parser is already in
error (e.g. by a missing C<my> under C<use strict;>) is now averted. This
was a regression since Perl 5.10.0. (Fixes RT #72590)

=item *

Reading C<$!> no longer causes a SEGV for out of range C<errno> values. (Fixes
RT #72850)

=item *

A possible SEGV in C</\N{...}/> has been fixed. This was a regression since
Perl 5.10.

=item *

A possible SEGV when freeing a scalar that was upgraded to an C<SVt_REGEXP>
type from a simple(r) scalar has been fixed.

=item *

A type conversion bug in C<gmtime64> that caused it to break around C<2**48>
has been fixed.

=item *

Filehandles are now always blessed into C<IO::File>, which, together with
some suitable manipulation of C<@IO::File::ISA>, fixes a breakage introduced
in Perl 5.11.3 by a change that always blessed filehandles into C<IO::Handle>
rather than checking for C<FileHandle> first.

=item *

A change in the behaviour of C<warnings::enabled> and C<warnings::warnif> in
Perl 5.10.0 that wasn't documented at the time is now documented in
L<perl5100delta>. (Fixes RT #62522)

=item *

RT #71504 is now fixed by simply skipping the tests that failed on OpenBSD
with ithreads and perlio.

=back

=head1 New or Changed Diagnostics

=over 4

=item *

C<gmtime> and C<localtime> called with numbers smaller than they can reliably
handle will now issue the warnings C<gmtime(%.0f) too small> and
C<localtime(%.0f) too small>.

=back

=head1 New Tests

=over 4

=item F<t/op/filehandle.t>

Tests some suitably portable filetest operators to check that they work as
expected, particularly in the light of some internal changes made in how
filehandles are blessed.

=item F<t/op/time_loop.t>

Tests that times greater than C<2**63>, which can now be handed to C<gmtime>
and C<localtime>, do not cause an internal overflow or an excessively long
loop.

=head1 Known Problems

Perl 5.11.5 is a development release leading up to Perl 5.12.0.
Some notable known problems found in 5.11.5 are listed as dependencies
of RT #69710, the Perl 5 version 12 meta-ticket.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.11.5 represents approximately one month of development since
Perl 5.11.4 and contains XXX lines of changes across XXX files
from XXX authors and committers:

XXX The list of people to thank goes here.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analyzed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
