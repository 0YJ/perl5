=head1 NAME

perl5160delta - what is new for perl v5.16.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and
the 5.16.0 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
L<perl5140delta>, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and
5.14.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 C<CORE::> works on all keywords

The C<CORE::> prefix can now be used on keywords enabled by
L<feature.pm|feature>, even outside the scope of C<use feature>.  Relevant
documentation files L<CORE>, L<feature>, L<perlfunc>, L<perlsub>, and
L<perlsyn> have been updated.

Perl 5.15.2 introduced subroutines in the CORE namespace.  Most of them
could only be called as barewords; i.e., they could be aliased at compile
time and then inlined under new names.

Almost all of these functions can now be called through references and via
C<&foo()> syntax, bypassing the prototype.  See L<CORE> for a list of the
exceptions.

=head2 C<continue> no longer requires the "switch" feature

The C<continue> keyword has two meanings.  It can introduce a C<continue>
block after a loop, or it can exit the current C<when> block.  Up till now,
the latter meaning was only valid with the "switch" feature enabled, and
was a syntax error otherwise.  Since the main purpose of feature.pm is to
avoid conflicts with user-defined subroutines, there is no reason for
C<continue> to depend on it.

=head2 New debugger commands

The debugger now has C<disable> and C<enable> commands for disabling
existing breakpoints and reënabling them.  See L<perldebug>.

=head2 C<$$> can be assigned to

C<$$> was made read-only in Perl 5.8.0.  But only sometimes: C<local $$>
would make it writable again.  Some CPAN modules were using C<local $$> or
XS code to bypass the read-only check, so there is no reason to keep C<$$>
read-only.  (This change also allowed a bug to be fixed while maintaining
backward compatibility.)

=head2 Features inside the debugger

The current Perl's feature bundle is now enabled for commands entered in
the interactive debugger.

=head2 C<\N{...}> can now have Unicode loose name matching

This is described in the C<charnames> item in
L</Updated Modules and Pragmata> below.

=head2 Breakpoints with file names

The debugger's "b" command for setting breakpoints now allows a line number
to be prefixed with a file name.  See
L<perldebug/"b [file]:[line] [condition]">.

=head2 C<splice()> doesn't warn when truncating

You can now limit the size of an array using C<splice(@a,MAX_LEN)> without
worrying about warnings.

=head2 The C<\$> prototype accepts any scalar lvalue

The C<\$> and C<\[$]> subroutine prototypes now accept any scalar lvalue
argument.  Previously they only accepted scalars beginning with C<$> and
hash and array elements.  This change makes them consistent with the way
the built-in C<read> and C<recv> functions (among others) parse their
arguments. This means that one can override the built-in functions with
custom subroutines that parse their arguments the same way.

=head2 You can now C<study> more than one string

The restriction that you can only have one C<study> active at a time has been
removed. You can now usefully C<study> as many strings as you want (until you
exhaust memory).

=head2 The Unicode C<Script_Extensions> property is now supported.

New in Unicode 6.0, this is an improved C<Script> property.  Details
are in L<perlunicode/Scripts>.

=head2 DTrace probes for interpreter phase change

The C<phase-change> probes will fire when the interpreter's phase
changes, which tracks the C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}> variable. C<arg0> is
the new phase name; C<arg1> is the old one. This is useful mostly
for limiting your instrumentation to one or more of: compile time,
run time, destruct time.

=head2 New Pad API

Many new functions have been added to the API for manipulating lexical
pads.  See L<perlapi/Pad Data Structures> for more information.

=head2 Subroutines in the CORE namespace

Many Perl keywords are now available as subroutines in the CORE namespace.
Most of these cannot be called through references or via C<&foo> syntax
yet, but must be called as barewords.  In other words, you can now do
this:

    BEGIN { *entangle = \&CORE::tie }
    entangle $variable, $package, @args;

This currently works for overridable keywords other than C<dump> and the
infix operators.  Calling through references only works for functions that
take no arguments (like C<wantarray>).

Work is under way to allow more of these subroutines to be called through
references.

=head2 C<__FILE__()> Syntax

The C<__FILE__>, C<__LINE__> and C<__PACKAGE__> tokens can now be written
with an empty pair of parentheses after them.  This makes them parse the
same way as C<time>, C<fork> and other built-in functions.

=head1 Security


=head2 C<File::Glob::bsd_glob()> memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).

Calling C<File::Glob::bsd_glob> with the unsupported flag
GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation / segfault.  A Perl
program that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose
itself to denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks.  There
are no known exploits in the wild.  The problem has been corrected by
explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
pointers to null.  Bug reported by Clément Lecigne.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 User-defined case changing operations.

This feature was deprecated in Perl 5.14, and has now been removed.
The CPAN module L<Unicode::Casing> provides better functionality without
the drawbacks that this feature had, as are detailed in the 5.14
documentation:
L<http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Case-Mappings-%28for-serious-hackers-only%29>

=head2 XSUBs are now 'static'

XSUB C functions are now 'static', that is, they are not visible from
outside the compilation unit. Users can use the new C<XS_EXTERNAL(name)>
and C<XS_INTERNAL(name)> macros to pick the desired linking behaviour.
The ordinary C<XS(name)> declaration for XSUBs will continue to declare
non-'static' XSUBs for compatibility, but the XS compiler,
C<ExtUtils::ParseXS> (C<xsubpp>) will emit 'static' XSUBs by default.
C<ExtUtils::ParseXS>'s behaviour can be reconfigured from XS using the
C<EXPORT_XSUB_SYMBOLS> keyword, see L<perlxs> for details.

=head2 Borland compiler

All support for the Borland compiler has been dropped.  The code had not
worked for a long time anyway.

=head2 Weakening read-only references

Weakening read-only references is no longer permitted.  It should never
hove worked anyway, and in some cases could result in crashes.

=head2 Tying scalars that hold typeglobs

Attempting to tie a scalar after a typeglob was assigned to it would
instead tie the handle in the typeglob's IO slot.  This meant that it was
impossible to tie the scalar itself.  Similar problems affected C<tied> and
C<untie>: C<tied $scalar> would return false on a tied scalar if the last
thing returned was a typeglob, and C<untie $scalar> on such a tied scalar
would do nothing.

We fixed this problem before Perl 5.14.0, but it caused problems with some
CPAN modules, so we put in a deprecation cycle instead.

Now the deprecation has been removed and this bug has been fixed.  So
C<tie $scalar> will always tie the scalar, not the handle it holds.  To tie
the handle, use C<tie *$scalar> (with an explicit asterisk).  The same
applies to C<tied *$scalar> and C<untie *$scalar>.

=head2 IPC::Open3 no longer provides C<xfork()>, C<xclose_on_exec()>
and C<xpipe_anon()>

All three functions were private, undocumented and unexported.  They do
not appear to be used by any code on CPAN.  Two have been inlined and one
deleted entirely.

=head2 C<$$> no longer caches PID

Previously, if one embeds Perl or uses XS and calls fork(3) from C, Perls
notion of C<$$> could go out of sync with what getpid() returns. By always
fetching the value of C<$$> via getpid(), this potential bug is eliminated.
Code that depends on the caching behavior will break.  As described in
L</Core Enhancements>, C<$$> is now writable, but it will be reset during a
fork.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.
In particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are
listed as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Future Deprecations

This section serves as a notice of feature that are I<likely> to be
L<deprecated|perlpolicy/deprecated> in the next release of perl (5.18.0).  If
your code depends on these features, you should contact the Perl 5 Porters via
the L<mailing list|http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html> or L<perlbug>
to explain your use case and inform the deprecation process.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

The short-circuiting operators C<&&>, C<||>, and C<//>, when chained
(such as C<$a || $b || $c>), are now considerably faster to short-circuit,
due to reduced optree traversal.

=item *

The implementation of C<s///r> makes one fewer copy of the scalar's value.

=item *

If a studied scalar is C<split> with a regex, the engine will now take
advantage of the C<study> data.

=item *

C<study> now uses considerably less memory for shorter strings. Strings shorter
than 65535 characters use roughly half the memory than previously, strings
shorter than 255 characters use roughly one quarter of the memory.

=item *

Recursive calls to lvalue subroutines in lvalue scalar context use less
memory.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

Warnings that mention the names of lexical (C<my>) variables with Unicode
characters in them now respect the presence or absence of the C<:utf8>

L<h2ph> used to generate code of the form

    unless(defined(&FOO)) {

But the subroutine is a compile-time declaration, and is hence unaffected
by the condition.  It has now been corrected to emit a string C<eval>
around the subroutine [perl #99368].

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

F<regexp.h> has been modified for compatibility with GCC's B<-Werror>
option, as used by some projects that include perl's header files (5.14.1).

=item *

C<USE_LOCALE{,_COLLATE,_CTYPE,_NUMERIC}> have been added the output of perl -V
as they have affect the behaviour of the interpreter binary (albeit only
in a small area).

=item *

The code and tests for L<IPC::Open2> have been moved from F<ext/IPC-Open2>
into F<ext/IPC-Open3>, as C<IPC::Open2::open2()> is implemented as a thin
wrapper around C<IPC::Open3::_open3()>, and hence is very tightly coupled to
it.

=item *

The magic types and magic vtables are now generated from data in a new script
F<regen/mg_vtable.pl>, instead of being maintained by hand. As different EBCDIC
variants can't agree on the code point for '~', the character to code point
conversion is done at build time by F<generate_uudmap> to a new generated header
F<mg_data.h>. C<PL_vtbl_bm> and C<PL_vtbl_fm> are now defined by the
pre-processor as C<PL_vtbl_regexp>, instead of being distinct C variables.
C<PL_vtbl_sig> has been removed.

=item *

Building with C<-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT> works again. This configuration is not
generally used.

=item *

The C<is_gv_magical_sv> function has been eliminated and merged with
C<gv_fetchpvn_flags>.  It used to be called to determine whether a GV
should be autovivified in rvalue context.  Now it has been replaced with a
new C<GV_ADDMG> flag (not part of the API).

=item *

Padlists are now marked C<AvREAL>; i.e., reference-counted.  They have
always been reference-counted, but were not marked real, because F<pad.c>
did its own clean-up, instead of using the usual clean-up code in F<sv.c>.
That caused problems in thread cloning, so now the C<AvREAL> flag is on,
but is turned off in F<pad.c> right before the padlist is freed (after
F<pad.c> has done its custom freeing of the pads).

All the C files that make up the Perl core have been converted to UTF-8.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=head2 Regular expressions and character classes

=over 4

=item *

The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier C</a> when repeated like
C</aa> forbids the characters outside the ASCII range that match
characters inside that range from matching under C</i>.  This did not
work under some circumstances, all involving alternation, such as:

 "\N{KELVIN SIGN}" =~ /k|foo/iaa;

succeeded inappropriately.  This is now fixed.

=item *

5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character
classes such as C<[\w\s]>, which have now been fixed (5.14.1)

=item *

An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop.
This happened only under C</i> in bracketed character classes that have
characters with multi-character folds, and the target string to match
against includes the first portion of the fold, followed by another
character that has a multi-character fold that begins with the remaining
portion of the fold, plus some more.

 "s\N{U+DF}" =~ /[\x{DF}foo]/i

is one such case.  C<\xDF> folds to C<"ss">. (5.14.1)

=item *

A few characters in regular expression pattern matches did not
match correctly in some circumstances, all involving C</i>.  The
affected characters are:
COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI,
GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA,
GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON,
GREEK PROSGEGRAMMENI,
GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND OXIA,
GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND TONOS,
GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA AND OXIA,
GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA AND TONOS,
LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S,
LATIN SMALL LIGATURE LONG S T,
and
LATIN SMALL LIGATURE ST.

=head2 Formats

=over

=item *

A number of edge cases have been fixed with formats and C<formline>;
in particular, where the format itself is potentially variable (such as
with ties and overloading), and where the format and data differ in their
encoding. In both these cases, it used to possible for the output to be
corrupted [perl #91032].

=item *

C<formline> no longer converts its argument into a string in-place.  So
passing a reference to C<formline> no longer destroys the reference
[perl #79532].

=back

=head2 Copy-on-write scalars

Copy-on-write scalars were introduced in 5.8.0, but most Perl code
did not encounter them (they were used mostly internally).  Perl
5.10.0 extended them, such that assigning C<__PACKAGE__> or a
hash key to a scalar would make it copy-on-write.  Several parts
of Perl were not updated to account for them, but have now been fixed.

=over

=item *

C<utf8::decode> had a nasty bug that would modify copy-on-write scalars'
string buffers in place (i.e., skipping the copy).  This could result in
hashes having two elements with the same key [perl #91834].

=item *

Lvalue subroutines were not allowing COW scalars to be returned.  This was
fixed for lvalue scalar context in Perl 5.12.3 and 5.14.0, but list context
was not fixed until this release.

=item *

Elements of restricted hashes (see the L<fields> pragma) containing
copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared
(C<%hash = ()>).

=item *

Localising a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a
copy-on-write string.

=item *

L<Storable>, L<Devel::Peek> and L<PerlIO::scalar> had similar problems.
See L</Updated Modules and Pragmata>, above.

=back

=head2 lvalue subroutines

There have been various fixes to lvalue subroutines.

=over

=item *

Explicit return now returns the actual argument passed to return, instead
of copying it [perl #72724] [perl #72706].

B<Note:> There are still some discrepancies between explicit and implicit
return, which will hopefully be resolved soon.  So the exact behaviour is
not set in stone yet.

=item *

Lvalue subroutines used to enforce lvalue syntax (i.e., whatever can go on
the left-hand side of C<=>) for the last statement and the arguments to
return.  Since lvalue subroutines are not always called in lvalue context,
this restriction has been lifted.

=item *

Lvalue subroutines are less restrictive as to what values can be returned.
It used to croak on values returned by C<shift> and C<delete> and from
other subroutines, but no longer does so [perl #71172].

=item *

Empty lvalue subroutines (C<sub :lvalue {}>) used to return C<@_> in list
context.  In fact, all subroutines used to, but regular subs were fixed in
Perl 5.8.2.  Now lvalue subroutines have been likewise fixed.

=item *

Lvalue subroutines used to copy their return values in rvalue context.  Not
only was this a waste of CPU cycles, but it also caused bugs.  A C<($)>
prototype would cause an lvalue sub to copy its return value [perl #51408],
and C<while(lvalue_sub() =~ m/.../g) { ... }> would loop endlessly
[perl #78680].

=item *

Autovivification now works on values returned from lvalue subroutines
[perl #7946].

=item *

When called in pass-by-reference context (e.g., subroutine arguments or a list
passed to C<for>), an lvalue subroutine returning arrays or hashes used to bind
the arrays (or hashes) to scalar variables--something that is not supposed to
happen.  This could result in "Bizarre copy of ARRAY" errors or C<print>
ignoring its arguments.  It also made nonsensical code like C<@{\$_}> "work".
This was fixed in 5.14.0 if an array were the first thing returned from the
subroutine (but not for C<$scalar, @array> or hashes being returned).  Now a
more general fix has been applied [perl #23790].

=item *

When called in pass-by-reference context, lvalue subroutines used to copy
any read-only value that was returned.  E.g., C< sub :lvalue { $] } >
would not return C<$]>, but a copy of it.

=item *

Assignment to C<keys> returned from an lvalue sub used not to work, but now
it does.

=item *

Applying the C<:lvalue> attribute to an XSUB or to an aliased subroutine
stub with C<< sub foo :lvalue; >> syntax stopped working in Perl 5.12.
This has been fixed.

=head2 Fixes related to hashes

=over

=item *

A bug has been fixed that would cause a "Use of freed value in iteration"
error if the next two hash elements that would be iterated over are
deleted [perl #85026]. (5.14.1)

=item *

Freeing deeply nested hashes no longer crashes [perl #44225].

=item *

Deleting the current hash iterator (the hash element that would be returend
by the next call to C<each>) in void context used not to free it.  The hash
would continue to reference it until the next iteration.  This has been
fixed [perl #85026].

=back

=head2 Other notable fixes

=over

=item *

Passing the same constant subroutine to both C<index> and C<formline> no
longer causes one or the other to fail [perl #89218]. (5.14.1)

=item *

List assignment to lexical variables declared with attributes in the same
statement (C<my ($x,@y) : blimp = (72,94)>) stopped working in Perl 5.8.0.
It has now been fixed.

=item *

Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made "U*" in the middle of
a pack template equivalent to "U0" if the input string was empty.  This has
been fixed [perl #90160].

=item *

Destructors on objects were not called during global destruction on objects
that were not referenced by any scalars.  This could happen if an array
element were blessed (e.g., C<bless \$a[0]>) or if a closure referenced a
blessed variable (C<bless \my @a; sub foo { @a }>).

Now there is an extra pass during global destruction to fire destructors on
any objects that might be left after the usual passes that check for
objects referenced by scalars [perl #36347].

This bug fix was added in Perl 5.13.9, but caused problems with some CPAN
modules that were relying on the bug.  Since it was so close to Perl
5.14.0, the fix was reverted in 5.13.10, to allow more time for the modules
to adapt.  Hopefully they will be fixed soon (see L</Known Problems>,
below).

=item *

C<given> was not calling set-magic on the implicit lexical C<$_> that it
uses.  This meant, for example, that C<pos> would be remembered from one
execution of the same C<given> block to the next, even if the input were a
different variable [perl #84526].

=item *

The "R" command for restarting a debugger session has been fixed to work on
Windows, or any other system lacking a C<POSIX::_SC_OPEN_MAX> constant
[perl #87740].

=item *

Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read
from when parsing a here document [perl #90128]. (5.14.1)

=item *

The C<study> function could become confused if fed a string longer than
2**31 characters.  Now it simply skips such strings.

=item *

C<each(I<ARRAY>)> is now wrapped in C<defined(...)>, like C<each(I<HASH>)>,
inside a C<while> condition [perl #90888].

=item *

In @INC filters (subroutines returned by subroutines in @INC), $_ used to
misbehave: If returned from a subroutine, it would not be copied, but the
variable itself would be returned; and freeing $_ (e.g., with C<undef *_>)
would cause perl to crash.  This has been fixed [perl #91880].

=item *

An ASCII single quote (') in a symbol name is meant to be equivalent to a
double colon (::) except at the end of the name.  It was not equivalent if
followed by a null character, but now it is [perl #88138].

=item *

The abbreviations for four C1 control characters
C<MW>
C<PM>,
C<RI>,
and
C<ST>
were previously unrecognized by C<\N{}>,
vianame(), and string_vianame().

=item *

Some cases of threads crashing due to memory allocation during cloning have
been fixed [perl #90006].

=item *

Attempting to C<goto> out of a tied handle method used to cause memory
corruption or crashes.  Now it produces an error message instead
[perl #8611].

=item *

Perl skips copying values returned from a subroutine if it thinks the value
is not in use elsewhere.  Due to faulty logic, this would happen with the
result of C<delete>, C<shift> or C<splice>, even if the result was
referenced elsewhere.  So C<< \sub { delete $_[0] }->($x) >> would return a
reference to C<$x>.  This has been fixed [perl #91844].

=item *

Applying the :lvalue attribute to subroutine that is already defined does
not work properly, as the attribute changes the way the sub is compiled.
Hence, Perl 5.12 began warning when an attempt is made to apply the
attribute to an already defined sub.  In such cases, the attribute is
discarded.

But the change in 5.12 missed the case where custom attributes are also
present: that case still silently and ineffectively applied the attribute.
That omission has now been corrected.  C<sub foo :lvalue :Whatever> (when
C<foo> is already defined) now warns about the :lvalue attribute, and does
not apply it.

L<attributes.pm|attributes> has likewise been updated to warn and not apply
the attribute.

=item *

The remaining discrepancies between explicit and implicit return from
lvalue subroutines have been resolved.  They mainly involved which error
message to display when a read-only value is returned in lvalue context.
Also, returning a PADTMP (the result of most built-ins, like C<index>) in
lvalue context is now forbidden for explicit return, as it always has been
for implicit return.  This is not a regression from 5.14, as all the cases
in which it could happen where previously syntax errors.

=item *

Explicitly returning a tied C<my> variable from an lvalue subroutine in
list lvalue context used to clear the variable before the assignment could
happen.  This is something that was missed when explicit return was made to
work in 5.15.0.

=item *

A minor memory leak, introduced in 5.15.0, has been fixed.  It would occur
when a hash is freed that has had its current iterator deleted
[perl #93454].

=item *

The C<prototype> function no longer dies for the C<__FILE__>, C<__LINE__>
and C<__PACKAGE__> directives.  It now returns an empty-string prototype
for them, because they are syntactically very similar to nullary functions
like C<time>.

=item *

C<prototype> now returns C<undef> for all overridable infix operators,
such as C<eq>, which are not callable in any way resembling functions.
It used to return incorrect prototypes for some and die for others
[perl #94984].

=item *

A bug affecting lvalue context propagation through nested lvalue subroutine
calls has been fixed.  Previously, returning a value in nested rvalue
context would be treated as lvalue context by the inner subroutine call,
resulting in some values (such as read-only values) being rejected.

=item *

Some core bugs affecting L<Hash::Util> have been fixed: locking a hash
element that is a glob copy no longer causes subsequent assignment to it to
corrupt the glob, and unlocking a hash element that holds a copy-on-write
scalar no longer causes modifications to that scalar to modify other
scalars that were sharing the same string buffer.

=item *

C<when> blocks are now capable of returning variables declared inside the
enclosing C<given> block [perl #93548].

=item *

A problem with context propagation when a C<do> block is an argument to
C<return> has been fixed.  It used to cause C<undef> to be returned in
some cases of a C<return> inside an C<if> block which itself is followed by
another C<return>.

=item *

Calling C<index> with a tainted constant no longer causes constants in
subsequently compiled code to become tainted [perl #64804].

=item *

Use of lexical (C<my>) variables in code blocks embedded in regular
expressions will no longer result in memory corruption or crashes.

Nevertheless, these code blocks are still experimental, as there are still
problems with the wrong variables being closed over (in loops for instance)
and with abnormal exiting (e.g., C<die>) causing memory corruption.

=item *

The C<SvIsCOW> C macro now returns false for read-only copies of typeglobs,
such as those created by:

  $hash{elem} = *foo;
  Hash::Util::lock_value %hash, 'elem';

It used to return true.

=item *

Assignment to C<$^A> (the format output accumulator) now recalculates
the number of lines output.

=item *

The regexp optimiser no longer crashes on debugging builds when merging
fixed-string nodes with inconvenient contents.

=item *

Locking a subroutine (via C<lock &sub>) is no longer a compile-time error
for regular subs.  For lvalue subroutines, it no longer tries to return the
sub as a scalar, resulting in strange side effects like C<ref \$_>
returning "CODE" in some instances.

C<lock &sub> is now a run-time error if L<threads::shared> is loaded (a
no-op otherwise), but that may be rectified in a future version.

=item *

The prototypes of several built-in functions--C<getprotobynumber>, C<lock>,
C<not> and C<select>--have been corrected, or at least are now closer to
reality than before.

=item *

Most dereferencing operators (C<${}>, etc.) used to call C<FETCH> twice on
a tied operand when doing a symbolic dereference (looking up a variable by
name, which is not permitted under C<use strict 'refs'>).  Only C<&{}> did
not have this problem.  This has been fixed.

=item *

A minor regression introduced in 5.15.0 has been fixed.  Dereferencing a
magical mortal (e.g., the return value of C<delete> on a tied hash element)
explicitly returned from a subroutine called recursively was not calling
C<FETCH>.  This would affect code like C<@{ foo() }> where the C<foo> sub
contains C<return delete $hash{elem}> and is calling itself.

=item *

A panic involving the combination of the regular expression modifiers
C</aa> and the C<\b> escape sequence introduced in 5.14.0 has been
fixed [perl #95964].

=item *

stat() would always return the inode number as an IV, even when the
original was unsigned, or too large to fit in an IV.  stat() now
returns the inode number as the type that would best preserve the
original value. [perl #84590]

=item *

The combination of the regular expression modifiers C</aa> and the C<\b>
and C<\B> escape sequences did not work properly on UTF-8 encoded
strings.  All non-ASCII characters under C</aa> should be treated as
non-word characters, but what was happening was that Unicode rules were
used to determine wordness/non-wordness for non-ASCII characters.  This
is now fixed [perl #95968].

=item *

Infinite loops like C<1 while 1> used to stop C<strict 'subs'> mode from
working for the rest of the block.t

=item *

The C<\h>, C<\H>, C<\v> and C<\V> regular expression metacharacters used to
cause a panic error message when attempting to match at the end of the
string [perl #96354].

=item *

For list assignments like C<($a,$b) = ($b,$a)>, Perl has to make a copy of
the items on the right-hand side before assignment them to the left.  For
efficiency's sake, it assigns the values on the right straight to the items
on the left no variable is mentioned on both sides, as in
C<($a,$b) = ($c,$d)>.  The logic for determining when it can cheat was
faulty, in that C<&&> and C<||> on the right-hand side could fool it.  So
C<($a,$b) = $some_true_value && ($b,$a)> would end up assigning the value
of C<$b> to both scalars.

=item *

Perl no longer tries to apply lvalue context to the string in
C<("string", $variable) ||= 1> (which used to be an error).  Since the
left-hand side of C<||=> is evaluated in scalar context, that's a scalar
comma operator, which gives all but the last item void context.  There is
no such thing as void lvalue context, so it was a mistake for Perl to try
to force it [perl #96942].

=item *

Every subroutine has a filename associated with it, that the debugger uses.
The one associated with constant subroutines used to be misallocated when
cloned under threads.  Consequently, debugging threaded applications could
result in memory corruption [perl #96126].

=item *

C<caller> no longer leaks memory when called from the DB package if
C<@DB::args> was assigned to after the first call to C<caller>.  L<Carp>
was triggering this bug [perl #97010].

=item *

In Perl 5.15.0 C<defined(${'$'})> stopped returning true if the C<$$>
variable had not been used yet.  This has been fixed.

=item *

C<defined(${"..."})>, C<defined(*{"..."})>, etc., used to
return true for most, but not all built-in variables, if
they had not been used yet.  Many times that new built-in
variables were added in past versions, this construct was
not taken into account, so this affected C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}> and
C<${^UTF8CACHE}>, among others.  It also used to return false if the
package name was given as well (C<${"::!"}>) and for subroutines in the
CORE package [perl #97978] [perl #97492] [perl #97484].

=item *

Perl 5.10.0 introduced a similar bug: C<defined(*{"foo"})> where "foo"
represents the name of a built-in global variable used to return false if
the variable had never been used before, but only on the I<first> call.
This, too, has been fixed.

=item *

Various functions that take a filehandle argument in rvalue context
(C<close>, C<readline>, etc.) used to call C<FETCH> multiple times, if it
was a tied variable, and warn twice, if it was C<undef> [perl #97482].

=item *

C<close> and similar filehandle functions, when called on built-in global
variables (like C<$+>), used to die if the variable happened to hold the
undefined value, instead of producing the usual "Use of uninitialized
value" warning.

=item *

When autovivified file handles were introduced in Perl 5.6.0, C<readline>
was inadvertently made to autovivify when called as C<readline($foo)> (but
not as C<E<lt>$fooE<gt>>).  It has now been fixed never to autovivify.

=item *

C<defined ${ $tied_variable }> used to call C<FETCH> multiple times, but
now calls it just once.

=item *

Some cases of dereferencing a complex expression, such as
C<${ (), $tied } = 1>, used to call C<FETCH> multiple times, but now call
it once.

=item *

For a tied variable returning a package name, C<$tied-E<gt>method> used to
call C<FETCH> multiple times (even up to six!), and sometimes would
fail to call the method, due to memory corruption.

=item *

Calling an undefined anonymous subroutine (e.g., what $x holds after
C<undef &{$x = sub{}}>) used to cause a "Not a CODE reference" error, which
has been corrected to "Undefined subroutine called" [perl #71154].

=item *

Causing C<@DB::args> to be freed between uses of C<caller> no longer
results in a crash [perl #93320].

=item *

Since 5.6.0, C<*{ ... }> has been inconsistent in how it treats undefined
values.  It would die in strict mode or lvalue context for most undefined
values, but would be treated as the empty string (with a warning) for the
specific scalar return by C<undef()> (C<&PL_sv_undef> internally).  This
has been corrected.  C<undef()> is now treated like other undefined
scalars, as in Perl 5.005.

=item *

It used to be possible to free the typeglob of a localised array or hash
(e.g., C<local @{"x"}; delete $::{x}>), resulting in a crash on scope exit.

=item *

C<setpgrp($foo)> used to be equivalent to C<($foo, setpgrp)>, because
C<setpgrp> was ignoring its argument if there was just one.  Now it is
equivalent to C<setpgrp($foo,0)>.

=item *

Assignments like C<*$tied = \&{"..."}> and C<*glob = $tied> now call FETCH
only once.

=item *

C<chdir>, C<chmod>, C<chown>, C<utime>, C<truncate>, C<stat>, C<lstat> and
the filetest ops (C<-r>, C<-x>, etc.) now always call FETCH if passed a tied
variable as the last argument.  They used to ignore tiedness if the last
thing return from or assigned to the variable was a typeglob or reference
to a typeglob.

=item *

Perl 5.15.1 inadvertently stopped C<*foo =~ s/\*//r> from working, as it
would try to force the *foo glob into a string.  This has been fixed
[perl #97954].

=item *

If things were arranged in memory the right way, it was possible for
thread joining to emit "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" warnings if
C<caller> had been used from the C<DB> package prior to thread creation,
due to the way pads were reference-counted and cloned [perl #98092].

=item *

CORE:: subs were introduced in the previous development release, but
C<defined &{"CORE::..."}> did not return true.  That has been rectified
[perl #97484].

=item *

Lvalue subroutines were made to autovivify in 5.15.0, but it did not work
in some cases involving an intervening list operator between the
dereference operator and the subroutine call (C<${(), lvsub()}>)
[perl #98184].

=item *

A bug has been fixed that occurs when a tied variable is used as a
subroutine reference:  if the last thing assigned to or returned from the
variable was a reference or typeglob, the C<\&$tied> could either crash or
return the wrong subroutine.  The reference case is a regression introduced
in Perl 5.10.0.  For typeglobs, it has probably never worked till now.

=item *

C<given> was not scoping its implicit $_ properly, resulting in memory
leaks or "Variable is not available" warnings [perl #94682].

=item *

C<-l> followed by a bareword no longer "eats" the previous argument to
the list operator in whose argument list it resides.  In less convoluted
English: C<print "bar", -l foo> now actually prints "bar", because C<-l>
on longer eats it.

=item *

In 5.14.0, filetest ops (C<-r>, C<-x>, etc.) started calling FETCH on a
tied argument belonging to the previous argument to a list operator, if
called with a bareword argument or no argument at all.  This has been
fixed, so C<push @foo, $tied, -r> no longer calls FETCH on C<$tied>.

=item *

C<shmread> was not setting the scalar flags correctly when reading from
shared memory, causing the existing cached numeric representation in the
scalar to persist [perl #98480].

=item *

Weakening the first argument to an automatically-invoked C<DESTROY> method
could result in erroneous "DESTROY created new reference" errors or
crashes.  Now it is an error to weaken a read-only reference.

=item *

Under miniperl (used to configure modules when perl itself is built),
C<glob> now clears %ENV before calling csh, since the latter croaks on some
systems if it does not like the contents of the LS_COLORS enviroment
variable [perl #98662].

=item *

C<++> and C<--> now work on copies of globs, instead of dying.

=item *

The subroutines in the CORE:: namespace that were introduced in the
previous development release run with the lexical hints (strict, warnings)
of the caller, just as though the built-in function had been called.  But
this was not the case for C<goto &CORE::sub>.  The CORE sub would end up
running with the lexical hints of the subroutine it replaced, instead of
that subroutine's caller.  This has been fixed.

=item *

Stacked C<-l> (followed immediately by other filetest operators) did not
work previously; now it does.  It is only permitted when the rightmost
filetest op has the special "_" handle for its argument and the most
recent C<stat>/C<lstat> call was an C<lstat>.

=item *

In Perl 5.6, C<-l> followed by anything other than a bareword would treat
its argument as a file name.  That was changed in 5.8 for glob references
(C<\*foo>), but not for globs themselves (C<*foo>).  C<-l> started
returning C<undef> for glob references without setting the last
stat buffer that the "_" handle uses, but only if warnings
were turned on.  With warnings off, it was the same as 5.6.
In other words, it was simply buggy and inconsistent.  Now the 5.6
behaviour has been restored.
