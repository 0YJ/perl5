?S:groupstype:
?S:	This variable defines GROUPSTYPE to be something like gid_t, int, 
?S:	ushort, or whatever type is used for the second argument to
?S:	getgroups().  Usually, this is the same of gidtype, but
?S:	sometimes it isn't.
?S:.
?C:GROUPSTYPE:
?C:	This symbol holds the type used for the second argument to
?C:	getgroups().  Usually, this is the same of gidtype, but
?C:	sometimes it isn't.  It can be int, ushort, uid_t, etc... 
?C:	It may be necessary to include <sys/types.h> to get any 
?C:	typedef'ed information.  This is only required if you have
?C:	getgroups().
